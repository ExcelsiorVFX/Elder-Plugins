Public Minecraft 1.8 Spigot plugins that I used to have on my server                                       



Hey everyone! My name is ExcelsiorVFX, and I am an experienced 1.8 Spigot plugin developer. Here, you can see some of my work. Enjoy, and don't use it without giving credit :)

# Descriptions

  1. King of the Ladder                                                           
       My only publicly released plugin. This plugin is very simple, however I have not updated it in a while so some features (like config files) aren't completely stable now.

  2. Spleef                                             
       My favorite plugin that I have written. It is the first plugin I wrote to implement a successfull waiting room / join buffer. It also works well by ensuring thread-safe block changes to the server.

  3. ExcelsiorBase API                                                    
       Some simple utility classes that I use in almost all of my plugins.
